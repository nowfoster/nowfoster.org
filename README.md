Next.js app for the III fostering project.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Node.js
- [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) account (free tier is fine)
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) account (free tier is fine)
- Google account and calendar (free)

## üß± How it works

### Quiz

The quiz is a series of sections, each of which has several questions, which in tern has several possible answers.

The content comes in dynamically from Contentful. We have some type-safety for the returned content by using `contentful-typescript-codegen` and the [Contentful management API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/) to automatically generate types for it.

As the user completes the quiz, it is saved to their browser's local storage.

### Applying

When the user finishes the quiz, they can choose to convert their quiz answers into a full application.

They can also choose an interview slot, powered by fetching all events on a Google calendar with zero attendees. The logic is stored in `lib/calendar.ts`.

Google recommends using a service account for this, but instead we use an OAuth2 refresh token to impersonate a normal user. This is because you seem to need a paid GSuite subscription in order to add attendees to an event with a service account.

Applying will:

- Save the user's details to FaunaDB
- Email the admin to let them know about the application
- Email a receipt to the applicant
- Add an attendee to the event they chose, therefore making it "unavailable" for the next applicant

## üíª Running it locally

First, run `cp .env.example .env` and fill in the values in the new .env file.

To run locally, do `npm run dev`

To lint, do `npm run lint`.

To run jest and cypress tests, do `npm test`.

## üåç Running it on the web

It's suitable for deploying anywhere a normal Next.js app is, like Netlify, Heroku or Vercel.

## üèï Environment

Most values are required for normal functionality.

## Google calendar integration

Integrating successfully with Google Calendar needs four things:

- `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID`, which can be found in the calendar settings, under "Integrate calendar". It might be the email address of the account the calendar is on.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` from [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com), which are:
  - able to access the Google Calendar API
  - has `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground` as an authorised redirect URI
- `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`, generated at [developers.google.com/oauthplayground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground)
  - authorised for the relevant Google Calendar API scopes
  - has "Use your own OAuth credentials" checked, with the client ID and secret from earlier
