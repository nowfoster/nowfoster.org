[![On push](https://github.com/jhackett1/iii-fostering-nextjs/actions/workflows/on-push.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jhackett1/iii-fostering-nextjs/actions/workflows/on-push.yml)

Next.js app for the III fostering project.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Node.js
- FaunaDB account
- Contentful account
- Calendly account
- Google account and calendar

## üß± How it works

### Quiz

The quiz is a series of sections, each of which has several questions, which in tern has several possible answers.

The content comes in dynamically from Contentful. We have some type-safety for the returned content by using `contentful-typescript-codegen` and the Contentful management API to automatically generate types for it.

As the user completes the quiz, it is saved to their browser's local storage.

### Applying

When the user finishes the quiz, they can choose to convert their quiz answers into a full application.

They can also choose an interview slot, powered by fetching all events on a Google calendar with zero attendees.

Applying will:

- Save the user's details to FaunaDB
- Email the admin to let them know about the application
- Email a receipt to the applicant
- Add an attendee to the event they chose, therefore making it "unavailable" for the next applicant

## üíª Running it locally

First, run `cp .env.example .env` and fill in the values in the new .env file.

To run locally, do `npm run dev`

To lint, do `npm run lint`.

To run jest and cypress tests, do `npm test`.

## üåç Running it on the web

It's suitable for deploying anywhere a normal Next.js app is, like Netlify, Heroku or Vercel.

## üèï Environment

All values are required for normal functionality.
